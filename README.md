## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Face Recognition System** that detects and recognizes faces in real-time using **OpenCV** and the **face_recognition** library. The system captures headshots, encodes face data, and matches faces in a live video stream.

### 🔹 **Key Features**
- 🚀 **Real-time Face Detection & Recognition**
- 📝 **Automatic Attendance Logging (CSV)**
- 📷 **User-Friendly Image Dataset Creation**
- 🔄 **Multi-Face Recognition**
- ⚡ **Optimized for Performance**

## **🔧 Installation Guide**
### **1️⃣ Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
python -m pip install cmake
python -m pip install face_recognition
python -m pip install opencv-python
python -m pip install imutils
```

## **🚀 How to Run the Project**
### **Step 1: Capture Images**
Run the following command to capture images for a new person:
```sh
python headshot.py
```
- Press **SPACE** to capture images.
- Press **ESC** to exit.

### **Step 2: Train the Model**
After collecting face images, train the model by encoding the faces:
```sh
python train_model.py
```

### **Step 3: Run Face Recognition**
Start real-time face recognition:
```sh
python facial_req1.py
```
- The system will recognize faces and log results in **recognized_faces.csv**.

---

## **📊 Output & Results**
✅ Recognized faces are displayed with **bounding boxes** and **names**.  
✅ Logs are saved in `recognized_faces.csv` with timestamps.  
✅ Encodings are stored in `encodings.pickle` for future recognition.  

---

## **🔹 Notes & Improvements**
- 🔧 Adjust **FACE_MATCH_THRESHOLD** in `facial_req1.py` for accuracy.
- 🖥️ Use **GPU acceleration** for better performance.
- 🎨 Consider adding a **GUI** for an enhanced user experience.
